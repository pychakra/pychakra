# Contributing to The Development of PyChakra

## A. Please check the version naming system first !

Typically, this is our system :

[MAJOR UPDATE].[MINOR UPDATE].[PATCH UPDATE]

Every step has it's pre-alpha, alpha, and beta stages.

### 1. Pre-Alpha :

You make changes, mostly "cleaning things up" before the
main show ! Make sure the code is clean and maintainable
before fixing bugs and stuff.

You can skip this stage if the code is clean.

### 2. Alpha Stage :

This is it !

#### - Alpha : Major Update.

If you are trying to make major update, make sure you
contacted the development team. Because major updates
are development team decision.

Major update is a drastic and a big change to the code.

#### - Alpha : Minor Update.

You are making minor update if you are implying small
features. In here, minor updates are not big deals after
all.

#### - Alpha : Patch Update.

Mostly all changes that could be considered to be a patch
update is just fixing bugs or cleaning codes.

### 3. Beta Stage :

After fixing bugs, cleaning codes, and implying features...
More bugs will surfaced to your eye-sight, in beta stage, it's
time to search and destroy all the bugs. If there are no bugs,
you can skip this stage.

## B. Check the existing bugs first !

When you are contributing, check the existing bugs first.
By fixing the bugs first, adding more features or rewriting
the code to make it more efficient would be easier doing all
of that stuff while fixing bugs.

## C. If you fix the bugs, then you are allowed to add features.

You can't bring a bookshelf if your room is full of unused and
dirty stuff you don't want, if your room is clean, you can bring
a bookshelf... which is a feature.

## D. Pull request are welcomed.

Since Im sometimes busy, sometimes I don't read pull requests,
so sorry if the pull request review is taking a lot of time!

Also, don't be shy to discuss your new features, your bugs fix,
or your clean code implementation ! You can e - mail us at :
[pychakra@gmail.com] .

## E. Create a Github issue...

If you discover some sort of bugs, you can create a Github issue.

There is no automatic bug-report system. The only way I can read
your complains and bug reports is through Github issue.

If you want a new feature, use the same method.. Github issue !

## F. Don't forget to read the license...

Yes I know, a lot of people skip license and "terms and conditions" .

But reading license makes you know how you are supposed to 
distribute the source code of PyChakra.

## G. How about maintainers ?

So far since this is a personal project, no maintainers.

## H. Who assigned maintainers ?

The owner of this Github account, and the author of this
project... [Ratpipe](https://github.com/ratpipedev)!
